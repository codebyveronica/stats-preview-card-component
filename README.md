## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a new css property, background-blend-mode, it was fun to use. I also learned that even though Flexbox is great, it is not always the best option.

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my knowledge and use of CSS properties to create better styles.
